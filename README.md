# Dark Souls Timeline

![Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/demo-GitHub%20Pages-blue) ![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-lightgrey) ![Repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/repo-dark--souls--timeline-black)

A bite-sized, slightly smoldering interactive timeline of Dark Souls lore — for people who read item descriptions like scripture and whisper “Praise the Sun” to their monitors.

Live demo: https://yourusername.github.io/dark-souls-timeline  (replace `yourusername` with the repo owner)

What you'll find
- Chronological entries covering major events from the Age of Ancients onward.
- Original Japanese keywords preserved for lore purists.
- Rich imagery and atmospheric visuals to set the mood (no spoilers, mostly ambiance).
- Small, tasteful nods to the community: NG+, bonfires, embers, and mild existential despair.

Why this exists
- Because someone had to make a timeline we could stare at between boss attempts.
- For lore dives, discussion starters, or humbling reminders that you missed an item description.

Contributing
- Corrections, additions, or meme-level improvements welcome via PRs or issues.
- Keep content respectful of the IP owners — this is a fan/portfolio project.

Credits & License
- Images and lore belong to FromSoftware / Bandai Namco.
- Code licensed MIT — see LICENSE.
